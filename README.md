# Stone Challenge - Mobile Engineer
### Chuck Norris Facts API

The challenge consisted in an app that uses the [Chuck Norris Facts API]( https://api.chucknorris.io/ ) to show the user researched facts. My solution consisted on a **iOS 14** app, built with **Xcode 12.1** , using **SwiftUI, Combine, UIKit, XCTest** frameworks.


## Why using SwiftUI and Combine?

One of the criteria was to deliver an optimized UI interface using the most modern techniques with native UI toolkits. And another was to implement reactive programming. 

And based on those criterias I saw the oportunity to use these two promising frameworks that were recently brought to us by our beloved Apple, frameworks that may still need to grow, but already show great potential in app development.

## To Run The App

Just clone the repo into your computer, open with xcode (preferr to use more recent versions, since the project was developed in iOS 14 and uses SwiftUI) and run the app on a simulator with iOS 14 or on a iPhone also running iOS 14. 

## Notes

If you're planning to use the Profile Instruments bare in mind that depending on your Xcode version it may acuse *invisible* memory leaks, since SwiftUI still has some bugs to correct.

## Thanks

Well, I appreciate the opportunity, it was already fun and a awesome way to train my knowledge and learn even more. Regardless the outcome of this selection process, I'd like to say thanks to you all.
